    """Permutation importance for feature evaluation.

    The permutation importance of a feature is calculated as follows. First,
    the estimator is trained on a training set. Then a baseline metric, defined
    by ``scoring``, is evaluated on a validation set. Next, a feature column
    from the validation set is permuted and the metric is evaluated again.
    The permutation importance is defined to be the difference between the
    baseline metric and metric from permutating the feature column.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object
        A estimator that has already been `fit` and is compatible with
        ``scorer``.

    X : array-like, shape = (n_samples, n_features)
        Training data.

    y : array-like, shape = (n_samples, ...)
        Target relative to ``X``.

    scoring : string, callable or None, optional (default=None)
        A string (see model evaluation documentation) or
        a scorer callable object / function with signature
        ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``.

    n_bootstrap : int, optional (default=30)
        Number of times to permute a feature

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default None
        The seed of the pseudo random number generator that selects a random
        feature to update.  If int, random_state is the seed used by the random
        number generator; If RandomState instance, random_state is the random
        number generator; If None, the random number generator is the
        RandomState instance used by `np.random`.

    Returns
